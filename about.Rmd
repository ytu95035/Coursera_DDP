# Goal of the project

- A Shiny application that has widget input, ui input in server.R, reactive output using server calculations, and supporting documentation.

- A Reproducible Pitch Presentation that contains five slides in R Presentation that is pushed to and hosted on GitHub and contains embedded R code that runs.

- All related souce codes are located at Github

# Diamond Data Set

- Diamond data is from ggplot2 package
- 53940 observations and 10 variables
```{r data, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
suppressWarnings(suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2)))
data("diamonds")
suppressMessages(str(diamonds))
```
- Price & 4c (carat, cut, color and clarity) have positive linear regression relationship
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=16,fig.height=14}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=carat, y=price, color=cut)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(color ~ clarity)
```


# Prediction Model

As ggplot shows that 4C has positive linear regression with diamond price.  The following predition model is used to predict the price.

## Model: lm(formula = I(log10(price)) ~ I(carat^(1/3)) + carat + cut + color + clarity, data = diamonds)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
 m1 <- lm(I(log10(price)) ~ I(carat^(1/3)), data = diamonds)
 m2 <- update(m1,~ . +carat)
 m3 <- update(m2,~ . +cut)
 m4 <- update(m3,~ . +color)
 m5 <- update(m4,~ . +clarity)
m5
```
The model is contributed by Solomon Messing.  Really appreciate for sharing the work.

The application provides the prediction model for you to predict the price by selecting specified 4c you want.

## So, you won't get ripped off EVER!!
